## Advent Of Code 2022 solutions

### Info:
- The test data for the tests are labeled in terms of days, and if there is a second data set for the same day, then they should exist as day(x)_2.txt, (x) being the day of advent of code.
- Solutions are in the src/bin/ folder labeled similary to data in rust .rs files.

Enjoy :smile:
